# Contributing back to ROS 2

Xilinx is a proud supporter of the ROS ecosystem, contributing to ROSCon and ROS-Industrial activities. While KRS focuses on [adaptive computing](https://www.xilinx.com/applications/adaptive-computing.html), as part of Xilinx commitment with ROS 2, the [ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Working Group (HAWG)](https://github.com/ros-acceleration) was created. With it, Xilinx is contributing back to the ROS 2 community and driving the creation, maintenance and testing of acceleration kernels on top of open standards (C++ and OpenCL) for optimized ROS 2 and Gazebo interactions over different compute substrates (including FPGAs and GPUs). The main driver behind this WG is summarized at the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) *"ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Architecture and Conventions"*. In here, Xilinx describes the architectural pillars and conventions required to introduce hardware acceleration in ROS 2 in a scalable and technology-agnostic manner.

As specified on its [community announcement](https://discourse.ros.org/t/proposal-for-ros-2-hardware-acceleration-working-group-hawg/20112), the HAWG targets hardware acceleration in a) embedded (edge) devices, b) workstations, c) data centers and d) cloud. A roadmap with objectives is available in the [community repository](https://github.com/ros-acceleration/community) of the Working Group, which Xilinx is driving and executing disclosing results as they become available.

Through the HAWG, Xilinx is demonstrating hardware acceleration capabilities in ROS 2 on edge devices with simple examples at the application layer that roboticists could use as blueprint for their designs. In the future, the group will also target ROS 2 underlayers to optimize interactions between nodes within the ROS 2 computational graph.
